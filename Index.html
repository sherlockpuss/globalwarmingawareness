        <p>

            Alot of people might say"why should we stop <br />

            <span class="hovertext" data-hover="The earth warming up because of excessive carbon dioxide">
                global warming?"
            </span>
            <br />
            and that is the problem. When people say that  more people might
            believe it. But if we don't stop global warming the human
            <span class="hovertext" data-hover="all the inhabitants of a particular town, area, or country.
                  An example is the island has a population of about 78,000 animals.">
                population
            </span>
            <br />
            will be extinct.How? Well, when you get sick your body gets
            white blood cells and starts to fight it off to cure your sickness.
            The same thing might happen to earth. And we the people are the germs
            . Think about it do you want to be the blood white cells or do you
            want to be the germs that is going to die? You probarlly want to be.
            the white blood cells. So if we can stop  global warming
            then we can still keep standing on the green fresh grass.

        <p>
            What is causing Global warming and how did it begin? Well, it all first started from one person
            throwing there garbage next to a garbage can and not pick it up.
            Then a bird or some animal ate it and died. But that is not all more and more
            people are doing that. By 2050 earth might not be the planet we want it to be. But if we take
            matters in to our hands now we can help stop global warming!
